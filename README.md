# OpenArkiv  
A censorship-resistant, offline-first data submission protocol for journalists, whistleblowers, and citizens in high-risk environments.

OpenArkiv enables encrypted messages to travel across phones using Bluetooth mesh networking until they reach a device with internet access, which submits the data to the Arkiv Network for permanent, verifiable storage. Users can choose between identity-backed submissions or fully anonymous whistleblower mode.

## 🚨 Why OpenArkiv?

Around the world, governments shut down the internet during protests, elections, and crises.  
This prevents:
- Journalists from transmitting evidence  
- Citizens from reporting abuses  
- Whistleblowers from leaking information safely  

**OpenArkiv ensures that truth can still flow — even when the internet doesn’t.**  
It creates a resilient pipeline that works in total blackout environments.

## 🧠 Core Concept

OpenArkiv combines:
1. **Offline Bluetooth Mesh Networking** (inspired by Jack Dorsey’s BitChat)  
2. **Anonymous, metadata-protected messaging** via **xxDK**  
3. **Tamper-proof, verifiable on-chain storage** using the **Arkiv Network**

The system moves data from:
**User → Nearby Devices (BLE) → Beacon → Arkiv DB-Chain**

No servers.  
No SIM cards.  
No internet required until the final step.
